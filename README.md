# Python Scripts! _(Have a Look Around!)_

### A creation of command line tools for making development faster

## Usage

#### You can clone the entire repository, or simply pick and choose which scripts fit your needs. Navigate to the respective README files in the project directories for further installation and usage instructions.

### Current CLI Projects:

### 1. [Trimmer](https://github.com/jIrwinCline/Python-Scripts/tree/master/trim-react-app)

    * CLI tool that trims down hefty boilerplate projects such as create-react-app
    * Speeding up the development process so you don't have to manually delete unused files on small or large apps!

### 2. ...ongoing additions!

## Projects completely developed in _Python_
