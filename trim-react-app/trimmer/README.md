# Trimmer-CLI

### A tool for a simple trim on a just created React project using create-react-app.

## Usage

#### Step by Step on installing and using trimmer:

### _To install_

> First clone the repository and cd into `/trim-react-app`

> In terminal: `$ pip install -e .`

### _To use_

> Meant to be used immediately after using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (i.e. `$ npx create-react-app <myProject>`

> cd into the root folder of your new project and don't edit anything

> In terminal: `$ trimmer trim`

#### Files will now be trimmed to an even more basic app.

### Files that are edited:

- App.js
- index.css
- index.js

### Files that are deleted:

- App.css
- App.test.js
- logo.svg
- serviceWorker.js

## Project completely developed in _Python_

### Known Issues:

#### Not yet compatible with the typescript boilerplate
